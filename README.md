PrivWindoze is a small batch script designed to quickly disable telemetry and remove a considerable amount of bloatware, including, but not limited to:

-  Microsoft Bing
-  Microsoft CoPilot
-  Microsoft Cortana
-  Microsoft Edge
-  Microsoft OneDrive
-  Microsoft Teams
-  Microsoft XBoxLive

There are currently no prompts or logs, but this may change in the future if there is enough interest.

This program is free to use, but if you wanted to donate something, check out this [link](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/C2QC509ZM1BG?ref_=wl_share). Thank you!
