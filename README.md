PrivWindoze is a small program designed for users that do not want to use the following products:

-  Microsoft Edge
-  Microsoft OneDrive
-  Microsoft XBoxLive

If you use these programs, ** DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPT!!! **

This program is also designed for those who value their privacy, so it quickly updates any telemetry settings so that you are not sending data to Microsoft's servers while using your PC.

To install:

1) Copy sed.exe from the dependencies folder into C:\WINDOWS. You can delete it afterwards if you'd like. More information about it is found in the sed-4.2.1-GnuWin.README
1A) For this program, it's currently only being used to locate a unique Microsoft Edge registry entry found at HKU\...\Run: [MicrosoftEdgeAutoLaunch_A63FDC39720E41B02CBAF0CFE9BA9509] The numbers here are unique per system.
2) Right-mouse click PrivWindoze\PrivWindoze.bat and select 'Run as administrator'
3) That's all!

This program is free to use but if you wanted to donate something, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/C2QC509ZM1BG?ref_=wl_share">this Amazon Wishlist link</a>. Thank you!
