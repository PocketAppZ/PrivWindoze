PrivWindoze is a small batch script designed to quickly remove telemetry and uninstall the following applications:

-  Microsoft Edge
-  Microsoft OneDrive
-  Microsoft Teams
-  Microsoft XBoxLive

There are currently no prompts or logs, but this may change in the future if there is enough interest.
